# 2025 ESU: AI and Images
Materials for AI and Images course at ESU 2025 in Besancon, France. 

The course is guided by three questions:

-  What is an image? What is AI?
-  How do we analyze images with AI?
-  What can we learn from analyzing images?

## Wednesday

### Teaser Session (1.5h)

### 7b (1.5h) AI: Distant Viewing Explorer
  - Visit [distantviewing.org/dvexplorer](distantviewing.org/dvexplorer)
  - Play around in pairs. Just explore! Select 2-3 of the models to share with the group. Explain why the group picked the model and data, what the model is doing, and what we might be able to learn by applying the approach. 
  - Discussion: How could we map the approaches and results of these algorithms onto concepts, ideas, and data that you care about? 

## Thursday 

### 8b (1.5h) AI and Moving Images
   -  Working with TV through [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1n7qWm47laCUJwg0-Rdx7pNw3dQWwuyxz?usp=sharing). 


### 9b (1.5h) AI:  What else can we do?
- Explore [Papers + Code](https://paperswithcode.com/methods) or [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) in a group.
- Select 1-2 methods to share with everyone and explain what the method does, why it interested your group, and how it might applied.
